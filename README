Project Website (PP IAIU)
=========================

Quick start
-----------

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root (or set environment variables). At minimum add:

```
MONGO_URI="mongodb://<user>:<pass>@host:port/<dbname>"
# Optional: PORT=3000
```

3. Start the server:

```powershell
npm start
```

4. Open in browser: http://localhost:3000

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If you see an error from `multer-gridfs-storage` about "At least one of url or db option must be provided", ensure `MONGO_URI` is set in your environment or `.env`.
- If you get authentication issues with MongoDB Atlas, make sure your IP is whitelisted and credentials are correct.

Notes
-----
- `package.json` includes `start` and `dev` scripts. `dev` uses `nodemon` (install globally if needed).
- The project uses GridFS for file uploads; the bucket names used are `uploadMember`, `uploadDivisi`, `uploadPeriode`.
